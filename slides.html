        # Getting Started

        You will need:

        1. **[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)** - a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features. If you are unable to install Sublime Text, try installing: [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows), [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Mac) or [Text Wrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) (Mac).

        1. **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-CA/chrome/browser/)** - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. To set Chrome as your default browser, follow [these instructions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?hl=en). Visit [browsehappy.com](http://browsehappy.com) for more info about modern browsers.

        1. A sense of adventure!!!
            
        **Bonus:** One of the great things about Sublime Text it that you can add extra functionality to it with *plugins*. [Go here](https://github.com/infn8/LLC-Intro-To-jQuery/blob/master/sublime-text-setup.md) to learn more about adding some cool functionality to your Sublime Text editor.

        #HTML + CSS + JavaScript = Basic web page

        **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** is a _markup_ language used to define the content.

        <p class="example">I'm just a paragraph.</p>

        **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a _style sheet_ language used to create the presentation and look of a site.

        <p class="example css">I'm a paragraph with <span>style</span>.</p>

        **JavaScript** is a _programming_ language used to define the behavior and used to add functionality to a website.

        <p class="example" onclick="alert('Clicked!');">I'm a paragraph that can be clicked. Try it!</p>

        # JavaScript is a Programming Language
        
        Because JavaScript is a programming language, the structure and syntax includes more complexities than HTML or CSS.  
        
        The basic building blocks of programming includes features such as *variables*, *functions*, *objects* or control structures such as *if* statements or *loops*.

        * is still JavaScript at its core 
        
        jQuery ***is*** JavaScript so it's important to have an understanding of some basic JavaScript principles first.
        
        Also, note that programming languages often require a little bit more code than HTML & CSS to see results in the browser.

        #The Console
        
        Before we get into the nitty-gritty details of these JavaScript principles, let’s take a look at a tool called the console.
        
        We'll be using this tool in the upcoming exercises to focus on getting used to the programming syntax. 
        
        This way, we can write programs without relying on HTML & CSS and learn some of the fundamental programming concepts first.

        The console in Chrome looks like this:
        ![The Console](framework/img/workshop/the_console_x.jpg)

        **Important!** The blue `>` symbol represents a space to enter your input but you don't have to actually type the symbol.

        #Accessing the Console

        You can open the console when viewing _any_ HTML page. In Chrome, there are different ways to open the Console tab.

        Keyboard shortcut:  
        `COMMAND + OPTION + J` (MAC)  / `CONTROL + SHIFT + J` (WINDOWS)

        OR

        Select: `View > Developer > JavaScript Console`.

        Open the console in this slide presentation. Take a moment to practice opening and closing the console until you’re comfortable with it.
        
        ---
        ###Pro tip! 
        The console also shows any errors on the page so if you open the console on any web page other than this slide deck, you *may* see some error messages.

        # Class Exercise: Working with Numbers

        In the console, after the `>` symbol, type your favorite number and press the enter/return key. You will see something like this:

        ![console number](framework/img/workshop/console-number.gif) <!-- .element: width="85%" -->

        The ```>``` symbol represents a space for your input.    
        The ```<``` symbol represents the **returned value** of your input.  
        
        ---
        ###Pro tip!
        To increase the font size of the console, use `Command/Control +`.  
        Use  `Command/Control 0` to return it back to the default size.

        # What *is* a variable?

        Variables are like containers or a box. 
        
        * used to *store* values 
        * can be used any time, whenever you need them
        * gives a *name* to a *value*. 
        
        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.
        
        For example, a variable could be used to store a customer's email address.  Then, the variable can be used to send a confirmation email.

        ```javascript
        var myVariable = "Hello!";
        ```

        The value `Hello` is given to the name `myVariable` and is declared using the keyword `var`. This is *assigning* a value to the *variable*. 
        
        Evaluate everything to the right of the equals sign, then assign the value to the variable on the left of the equals sign.

        # Variable Types: Strings

        When storing text values, like words or sentences, the variable type is a *string* value.
        
        Strings must be contained in quotes.

        ```javascript
        var greeting = "Hello!";
        ```
        
        ```javascript
        var greeting = "Good morning!";

        var greeting = "Good";
        var greetingTime = "morning";
        var greetingFull = greeting + " " + greetingTime + "!";

        var greetingFull = greeting + " " + greetingTime + "!";
        var greetingFull = Good + space + morning + exclamation mark

        #Class exercise: Using Variables
        
        When using the console tool, it will automatically return a value when you input an instruction. Declaring a variable just *stores* the value until you're ready to use it. 
        
        `var favFood` is just holding on to the value, so it returns nothing (undefined). But now, JavaScript knows it exists. 
        
        To actually **use** the variable, just type `favFood` into the console. It will now **return** the value that it was storing and look something like this:
        
        ```javascript
        > var favFood = "pizza";
        < undefined
        > favFood;
        < "pizza"

# Variable Types: Strings and Quotes

Strings values can be wrapped in either 'single quotes'  or "double quotes."  You can use either style but you must start and end the string with the same mark.

But be careful! In the example below, this will cause an error.

```javascript
var fails = 'This string's value is not going to work!'; 
/*          ^           ^
            |___________| 
            |
            Javascript thinks the second apostrophe closes the first.
            It then expects the command to end with a semicolon (;) 
            right after and returns an error.

        # Variable Types: Strings and Quotes

        There's two ways to fix it.

        var works = "This string's value is going to work!";                                 
        ```

        Or *escape* it by using a backslash.

        ```javascript
        var alsoWorks = 'This string\'s value is not going to work!'; 
        ```

        ```
        var meaningOfLife = 42;
        ```

        JavaScript can also do math.  
        
        `+` addition, `-` subtraction, `*` multiplication, `/` division

        ```javascript
        var addition = 5 + 2;

        # Exercise: Create a JavaScript Program! (10-15 mins)

        Using variables & arithmetic operators, calculate how many seconds there are in a day.

        1. Declare variables for: `secondsPerMinute`, `minutesPerHour` and `hoursPerDay`.  
        1. Declare a `secondsPerDay` variable and use arithmetic operators to calculate the value.

        Feel free to use your own variable names. Just make sure to adhere to best practices.

        **Bonus!** Use concatenation to output "There are x seconds per day."

        **Objects** can be thought of as a variable that can hold *multiple* values. To *declare* an object, use the curly brackets `{}`. 
        
        The values are written in `property: value` pairs. Each pair is separated by a comma, except for the last one.

        ```javascript
        var myObject = {
          propertyName: propertyValue,
          anotherPropertyName: anotherPropertyValue
        }

        # Variable Types

        As you've just seen, there are *many* different variable types in JavaScript and many rules about how to write them. 
        
        There are actually a few more. You can read all about them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures).

        It will take practice getting used to the different rules. But, in a nutshell, *variables* are used to hold values and the values themselves have different *types*.

        # Functions

        A `function` is a name for a **set** of commands or instructions.  
        
        When using a function, it executes all the commands contained within, making it easier to make the code repeat repetitive steps.  

        Let's look at two functions, `alert()` and `prompt()`.  These come built into JavaScript, for free! Note the syntax, the parentheses `()`, must be included.

        > Go back to the console and type both functions in, one at a time, and see what happens.

        #Functions and Arguments

        We've seen now that `alert()` and `prompt()` create a pop-ups in the browser but the pop-ups are blank.  An *argument* can be *passed* into the functions by adding a value within the parentheses `()`.  
        
        Try this in the console:

        ```javascript
        alert("Hello!");
        ```
        ```javascript
        prompt("What day is it today?");
        ```

        It will look similar to this:

        # Make your own functions!

        You can create your own functions that can contain any number of instructions that you need, including other functions. Use the `function` keyword to declare a new function.

        Let's look at this example: 

        ```javascript
        function sayAnything(){
          alert("Hello!");
          prompt("What day is it today?");
        }
        ```
        The above example creates a new **function** called `sayAnything` but similar to variables, nothing will happen until the function is **called**.

        #Calling a function
        
        To **call** a function, use the function name plus parentheses `()`.  Remember `alert();` and `prompt();`?  
        
        Let's add this whole function declaration into the console and then execute it by *calling* it.
        
        ```javascript
        function sayAnything(){
          alert("Hello!");
          prompt("What day is it today?");
        }

        What's the difference between these two?  The second one kind of looks like a function right?
        ``` javascript
        alert();
        console.log();
        ```

        `alert()` is a **function**, it works on its own.

        `log()` is a **method** because it's attached to an **object**, `console`. It will log a message only into the console tool. 

        This is much easier for testing and debugging than using `alert()`. No more pesky pop-ups!

# Using jQuery
                    
You know how to use jQuery because you know how to select **HTML elements** with **CSS selectors**.

```css
.menu-item { color: blue; }
/*   |        |      |
     |        |      └ The value of the CSS property.
     |        └ The CSS property. 
     └ HTML elements with a class of 'menu-item' are selected.   
*/
```

That same code in jQuery is done like this:

```javascript
jQuery('.menu-item').css('color', 'blue');
/* ^         ^        ^     ^        ^
   |         |        |     |        └ The second parameter sets the css value.  
   |         |        |     |   
   |         |        |     └ The first parameter sets the css property.
   |         |        |     
   |         |        └ The jQuery 'css' method is called and will change  
   |         |          the css of the element selected in the previous step.
   |         |
   |         └ The argument sent to the jQuery function is a 'string' value
   |           that takes the form of a css selector.
   | 
   └ The jQuery function. This is super important because this makes everything else work.

* Serve a random background image each time a page loads.
* Create an 'infinite scroll' effect by loading more items when a user reaches the bottom of the page
* Create complex layouts that are not possible with CSS alone.
* Detect the capabilities of a browser before serving up functionality like CSS Animations.

#Setting up our work flow

For the rest of the day, you'll be working with the files included in the <strong>project</strong> folder.  Let's take a moment to set up the work flow.
Inside of the folder you downloaded today (**llc-intro-to-jquery-master**), there are many folders and files that contain different content.

    llc-intro-to-jquery-master
        |-- framework // Contains files needed for slide presentation. Do not edit!
        |-- project // Contains files for today's workshop.
            |-- css // Only CSS files here.
            |-- final // A complete example of today's project for your reference.
            |-- images // Images for your project. You can also add your images here.
            |-- js // All your js files go here.
            |-- index.html // The homepage of your site.

#Setting up our work flow

Let's open the project files in the browser and text editor.

* Open Sublime Text, then go to **File > Open**.
* Navigate to the **project** folder (inside the folder you downloaded with today's slides).
* With the entire folder selected, select **Open**.
* The folder will appear in the side bar. Double click on **index.html** in the sidebar to open it in the editor.
* Right click or two finger tap in Sublime and select Open in Browser. This will open the HTML file in your default browser.
    * If Chrome is not your default browser, go to your Window/Finder and navigate to the **project** folder, right-click/two-finger tap on **index.html** and choose **Open With > Chrome**

You should see this in Sublime Text:

            <h1>Using jQuery</h1>
            <p>To use jQuery on your HTML page, you'll have to link to the jQuery file.  There are two ways to do that.</p>

            <p>1. <strong>Include the jQuery files with your project files:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://jquery.com/download/">Download the latest version of jQuery</a> and use the latest, compressed version. </li>
                <li>Save it within your projects files.  It’s common to create a separate <strong>js</strong> folder for all JavaScript files for organization (similar to how there are separate images and css folders.)</li>
                <li>Link it to your HTML document using a script tag.  The <code>src</code> should point to the path to where the file is saved in your project’s folder structure.<br>
                Your project folder already has the jQuery file included so no need to download anything today.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <pre><code class="xml">< cript src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script></code></pre> -->

            <p><strong>Important</strong>:  Unlike CSS, which always has to be included within the <code><head&gt;</code> tags, JavaScript can be included pretty much anywhere on the page, in the <code><head&gt;</code> or the <code><body&gt;</code>.  Often, it is included just before the closing <code></body&gt;</code> to allow the page document to load first.</p>

            <p>2. <strong>Use a CDN:</strong></p>
            <p>CDNs can offer a performance benefit by hosting jQuery on servers spread across the globe.</p>

            <p>To use the jQuery CDN (also listed on the download page), reference the file directly from the hosted file, rather than pointed to a file in your directory. Be sure to include the "http://" when viewing the site locally (on your computer).</p>
            <pre><code class="xml"><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script></code></pre>

            <p>Insert it into your <strong>index.html</strong> page now.</p>

            <div class="presenter-notes">
                <p>The examples in jQuery's Learning Center uses the script at the bottom so use it this way to be consistent.</p>

    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <!-- <script type="text/template">  -->

<!-- <pre><code class="javascript"><s cript src="js/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"&gt;<&#47;&#115;cript&gt; -->
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="javascript">/* |    |                 |              └ The closing 'script' tag.
   |    |                 └ The location of the JS file.
   |    └ The 'src' attribute of the 'script' tag expects a file location.
   |
   └ The 'script' tag.  In HTML this tells the document that it's about to get JS commands.
*/
</code></pre>
            <p>Now that we've linked the jQuery file, we can access all the commands written in that document and be able to access all of the features available.</p>

            <p>Great! Now, open <strong>index.html</strong> in Chrome, or refresh the page if you have it open already and see what jQuery does when you include it in an HTML file.</p>

        # Notice any difference in your project?
        ## No?

        That's because the jQuery library on its own doesn't DO anything, it simply gives you the tools to do something. What we do is up to us.

        Now that jQuery is on the page we can use the `$();` function which is the real magic of jQuery.

        A popular use for jQuery is to target an item on the page and add or change the behavior of that item.
      </script>
    </section>
    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template"> 
# How to select an item with $(); 

The ```$();``` function takes a single parameter:  A string containing either a CSS selector or HTML element indicating what item(s) on the page to select.

In the example below, this will select all list items, with a class of "even" in an any unordered list.

```javascript
$("ul li.even");
```
This will select the first item with a class of "slide" inside the item with an id of "rotator".
```javascript
$("#rotator .slide:first");
```

The HTML items that match the selector are added into something called the **wrapped set**.  This is a special grouping of items that jQuery uses to know what items to alter or add behavior to.

When you run a jQuery **method**, only the items in the **wrapped set** will be altered or affected.

            <h1> jQuery Methods </h1>
            <p> The jQuery library comes with many many MANY different methods.  We won't be able to discuss all of them today but to see what methods are available, and how to use them, go to <a href="http://api.jquery.com">api.jquery.com</a>.</p>
            <p>We will discuss a few methods here and a few more once we start making our image rotator.</p>

                <li>the <code>.hide();</code> method will hide all elements in the wrapped set.</li>
                <li>the <code>.show();</code> method will show all elements in the wrapped set.</li>
                <li>the <code>.css();</code> method alters the look of the elements in the wrapped set by passing two parameters.

# Timing

The browser downloads all web pages from top to bottom and when it see any JavaScript, it runs it.  Right then and there.  So if you add this:

```javascript 
$("p.highlight").css("background-color", "yellow");
```
before you add this:

```xml
<p class="highlight">This is an important highlighted paragraph</p>
```
The JavaScript code will run BEFORE the browser sees the paragraph tag.  jQuery won't be able to match the element and won't change the background colour to yellow!

            <h1>Enter Document Ready</h1>

            <p><code>$( document ).ready()</code> is an <strong>event</strong>.  It’s a <em>point in time</em> when the browser has downloaded enough of the web page to see all the tags and will able to match the elements selected in your jQuery code.</p>
            <p>Running that same code in the <strong>document ready</strong> event looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $("p.highlight").css("background-color", "yellow");

#Comments!

Just like HTML and CSS, you can also leave comments in JavaScript/jQuery.  You've already seen them throughout this presentation.  You may want to write notes to yourself (or others) to organize blocks of code or leave explanations. JavaScript will ignore comments and not execute them.

    // This is how you leave a single line comment.

    // You can write many single line comments.
    // Just make sure to add the double slash
    // for every new line.

Here's another way to comment larger blocks of text.

```javascript
/* This is how you leave
multi-line comments for when you
want to write a longer message */
```

Multi-line comments are great for "hiding" large blocks of code so you can try something new without erasing your old code.

Let's change the size of the image using the `.width()` jQuery method. You can pass a size argument into the parentheses. Update your `.fav-img` object by using **dot notation** to apply the `.width()` method.

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $(".fav-img").width(100);
});
```
Save the file in Sublime, go to Chrome and refresh the page.  If you've done it right it should look like this:

#Click Events

Now you've seen that you can set the width of an element with jQuery but we could use CSS to do that.  

Let's try something only JavaScript could help us with, the **click event**.

Like the document ready **event**, a click event is a moment in time when we want to trigger some code to run.  But instead of the browser running the event right away, it only runs when an item is actually clicked by the user.

Adding a function to a **user triggered event** is called an **event listener**.  The code just sits around waiting and listening for the event to happen.  When someone finally clicks the item, it triggers the function to run. 

We'll be going through an example together but you can also view the documentation here: [http://api.jquery.com/click/](http://api.jquery.com/click/)
        </script>
</section>

        <section class="slide">
            <h1>Click Events</h1>
            <p>To add an event listener, select the target item just like anything else with jQuery.</p>
<pre><code>$(".fav-img");
</code></pre>

            <p class="delayed">Then add the <code>.click()</code> method.</p>

<pre class="delayed"><code>$(".fav-img").click();
</code></pre>

            <p class="delayed">Then pass a single parameter to the <code>click()</code> method. That parameter is itself a function. Add <code>function(){}</code> into the parentheses.</p>

<pre class="delayed"><code>$(".fav-img").click(function(){});
</code></pre>

            <p class="delayed">Inside of that function, in between the curly braces <code>{}</code>, this is where we'll add the instructions for what to do when the image is clicked.</p>
<pre class="delayed"><code>$(".fav-img").click(function(){
    // The changes that occur when object is clicked.
});
</code></pre>
        </script>

#Testing with `console.log();`

Let's test the click event and make sure we've selected the correct object.  Remember `console.log()`?  This method if very handy for testing and debugging. 

Testing the click even will let you know this step is working before you move onto the next step.

```javascript
$(".fav-img").click(function(){ 
    console.log("It works!");
});
```

Refresh your page, open the console on your page and click an image.  You should see the message you passed into the `console.log()` method like this:

![console.log example](framework/img/workshop/console-log.gif)
        </script>
</section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
#Click & Hide

Now that we know the click event works, you can delete the `console.log` test or comment it out. Next, let's make the click event hide the picture. Use `$(this)` as the selector (more on this soon).  
Then add the `.hide()` method.
```javascript
$(".fav-img").click(function(){ 
    //console.log("It works!");
    $(this).hide();
});
```
The code above will take the clicked image and *dynamically* add inline CSS to the HTML element.  It will add  `style="display:none;"` to the element to hide it, though the item is still in the HTML. 

Let's add this to our project and **inspect the element** to see how jQuery adds these changes. You should see something like the below screen shot in your console.

![show hide console example](framework/img/workshop/console-show-hide.png)

</section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
#Click & Hide: Adding parameters

The `hide()` **method** also accepts a **parameter** for how long it should take for this effect to to occur.  Add a number, in milliseconds, in the parentheses.

```javascript
$(".fav-img").click(function(){ 
    $(this).hide(1000);
});
```

This will make the act of hiding the image take 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second.

In jQuery, any time you can provide a duration to an animation, you can either use a number in milliseconds, or a string value of either "fast" or "slow" which mean 200 and 600 milliseconds respectively. If you do not supply a value, jQuery will use the default value of 400 milliseconds.

Add it to your project to see it in action.  Try experimenting with different numbers or use the keywords.

#Click & Chain events

What if we just want to hide it for a bit, then show it again?  We can by **chaining** our methods.

```javascript
$(".fav-img").click(function(){ 
    $(this).hide(1000).show('fast');
});
```

jQuery methods are chained together with a dot (.) in between them.  That means that the below example is perfectly valid and will work just fine. Though this example is kinda silly, it's fun to just experiment sometimes! 

```javascript
$(".fav-img").click(function(){ 
    $(this).hide(1000).show('fast').fadeOut('slow').fadeIn(5000).slideUp(800).slideDown(10000);
});

# What the heck is ```$(this)```?!?!

Why have we been using `$(this)` as a selector for the previous exercises? What is it and what does it do?  

## Good question!

jQuery gives us a special variable called ```this``` as a helper.  Though we want to select the image, we want to select **only the specific image** that is being clicked at that moment. The below example would make all the matched images hide on click.

```javascript
$(".fav-img").click(function(){ 
    $(".fav-img").hide(1000);
});
```

`$(".fav-img").click()` will watch for *any* image being clicked.   
`$(".fav-img").hide(1000);` will add the hide effect to **all** the matched elements.

The below code, will ensure that only the clicked item will have the hide action applied to it.

```javascript
$(".fav-img").click(function(){ 
    $(this).hide(1000);
});
```

`$(".fav-img").click()` will watch for *any* image being clicked.   
`$(this).hide(1000);` will add the hide effect to only the matched element that was clicked, so only the clicked image will be hidden.

#Exercise: Active Menu

Let's use the jQuery `click()`, `addClass()` and `removeClass()` methods to create an `.active` class to style the menu item differently when clicked.  Here are the instructions  we'll create with jQuery:

1. Select the elements to be clicked.
1. Add a class of "active" to invoke a new style.
1. Add the "active" class style to the CSS file.
1. When the user clicks on another menu item, add the "active" class to the new item and remove the active class from non-active items.

                <p>Wait? Nothing happened?</p>

                <p>That’s because we haven’t added the style in the CSS file yet.  You can still check if it’s been added to the HTML.  If your console is still open, just click on the “Elements” tab.</p>

                <p>Now go to <strong>style.css</strong> to create a new CSS style for the active state. This will change the color (but you can apply whatever style you like). Since the color has been added to <code>.menu a</code>, create a selector using the new <code>active</code> class</p>

<pre><code>.menu a.active {

#Exercise: Active Menu - `removeClass()` method

Almost there.  We were able to add the class to the clicked item but now we need to remove the class from the non-active items.  Remember, JavaScript/jQuery executes commands from top to bottom.  One way to fix this issue is to remove the class **first**, *then* add the class to the clicked item.

In this case, we won't use the `$(this)` selector since we are looking for any element with the `active` class to remove it. That means `.active` will be our selector.
    
```javascript  
$(".menu a").click(function(){
    //console.log("It works!");
    $(".active").removeClass("active");
    $(this).addClass("active");
});
```

Now try it!

**Note**: if the class of `active` is used anywhere else on the page, it will be affected as well.  Another option is to use a selector more specific to the menu such as `$(".menu a.active")`.

            #Exercise: Personalize Your Page (15-20mins)

            Now that you've had a chance to get some JavaScript & jQuery practice, take some time to personalize your page. Here are some suggestions to get you started: 

            1. Update the banner headings.
            2. Add your profile image.
            3. Update your favorite things images.

            **Bonus**

            1. Prepare for the next exercise.  We will be creating an image rotator.  Find four images and just add them to your images folder for now.  You don't need to add it to your HTML page just yet.
            2. Update the banner background image.

# jQuery Plugins

jQuery is an extremely capable library on its own.  It comes with hundreds of **methods**, many other helper **properties** and the ability to select items for the wrapped set based on **CSS Syntax**.

## But jQuery doesn't & can't do everything.  

There would be no way to write a library with methods to handle everything any user would ever want to do.  Even if that was possible, it would make the library so large that it would take browsers a very long time to download it and the initial page loading speed of any site that used it would be *VERY SLOW*.  

## Enter Plugins

A jQuery plugin is some code that *someone else* has written, that you can use, to achieve certain goals that the jQuery library itself is not designed to handle.

# jQuery Plugins

Some examples of jQuery plugins are 

* [Scroll Magic](http://janpaepke.github.io/ScrollMagic/)
    * A plugin to make it easy to add effects based on the user's scroll position on the page
* [ToolTipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/#demos)
    * Custom pretty Tool Tips
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/)
    * A collection of UI widgets designed to make adding complex user interactions easier and very themeable
        * This plugin is developed by the jQuery team itself
        * **UI = User Interface**
* [FlexSlider](http://flexslider.woothemes.com/)
    * A responsive photo slider
 
We are going to use the FlexSlider plugin today to add a slider of images to our project.

# So, What IS an image rotator?

At its most basic, a rotator is a list of images that uses javascript to show one image on its own, then another, then another...  SO if we used HTML like this:

```xml
<div id="rotator">
    <ul class="slides">
        <li><img src="img/rotator/image1.jpg" alt="First Slide"></li>
        <li><img src="img/rotator/image2.jpg" alt="Second Slide"></li>
        <li><img src="img/rotator/image3.jpg" alt="Third Slide"></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

The javascript would show the first and hide the rest. Then, after a couple of seconds,  show the second and hide the rest.  Then keep going until all of the slides have been shown.  Then start again at the beginning. 
        </script>

            <h1>Enter Flexslider</h1>

            <p>Flexslider is a capable, well maintained and responsive jQuery rotator. Best of all it’s free and easy to use.</p>

            <p>Head on over to <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/">http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/</a> to download the files.</p>

            <p>Click the big green download button to download the zip file. Included in the download are many files that we'll need to make the plugin work and there are other files that are just for demo purposes. You will see something like this:</p>

            <p><img src="framework/img/workshop/flexslider-contents.png" alt="Flexslider in the project directory" title=""></p>

            <p>These are the files you will need to <strong>copy</strong> into your project folder, into the appropriate directory.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>entire <strong>fonts</strong> folder into the <strong>project</strong> folder</li>
                <li>flexslider.css into the <strong>css</strong> folder</li>
                <li>images > bg_play_pause.png into your <strong>project > images</strong> folder</li>
                <!-- <li>jquery.flexslider-min.js into your <strong>project > js</strong> folder</li> -->
            </ul>

            <p>Your project folder should now look like this:</p>
            <img src="framework/img/workshop/folders-with-flexslider.png" alt="">
            <p>Your images files may vary but just ensure that <strong>bg_play_pause.png</strong> is included.</p>

            <h1>Add Flexslider to Your project: Step 1</h1>
            <p>Now that the plugin files are saved within your directory, attach these files to your HTML page.</p>

            <!-- <p>Go to back to your <strong> index.html </strong> file and add the Flexslider file (<strong>jquery.flexslider-min.js</strong>) <em>after</em> the jQuery library file <nobr>(<strong>jquery-1.11.1.min.js</strong>).</nobr></p> -->

<!-- <script src="js/jquery.flexslider-min.js"&gt;<&#47;&#115;cript&gt; -->
<script&gt;
$(document).ready(function(){
    // Add all jQuery code here.
});
<&#47;&#115;cript&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>Flexslider also comes with its own CSS file, so be sure to put that in the <code><head></code> section <em>before</em> style.css.</p>
<pre><code><head&gt;
    <title&gt;Page Title</title&gt;
    <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'&gt;

    <link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot;&gt;
</head&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is just one way to organize your folder structure. Some people like to create a <strong>plugins</strong> folder for example for these types of files.  Just make sure that your file paths match when linking to the js, image and css files.</p>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>

#Add Flexslider to Your project: Step 2

Now, let's write the HTML markup for creating the structure of the slider. In the Flexslider documentation, the markup is provided. It's important to use the same structure and class and/or id names as listed because most times, plugins are created to match that specific chunk of code.  

You can of course update the src file for the images to point to your own.  If you do not have any images at this time, there are some placeholders in your project folder under **images > rotator**.

```xml
<div class=&quot;flexslider&quot;&gt;
  <ul class=&quot;slides&quot;&gt;
    <li&gt;<img src=&quot;images/rotator/image1.jpg&quot;&gt;</li&gt;
    <li&gt;<img src=&quot;images/rotator/image2.jpg&quot;&gt;</li&gt;
    <li&gt;<img src=&quot;images/rotator/image3.jpg&quot;&gt;</li&gt;
  </ul&gt;
</div&gt;
```

You can put this code anywhere you want it to show on the page. Save the file and check your page.  You probably won't see anything right?  That's because we still have to activate the plugin with a little jQuery.

**Note!** You will see the example image tag code in the Flexslider documentation with an extra forward slash at the end of the image tag.  This is the XHTML syntax (previous version).  HTML5 doesn't require it.


```xml
<!-- XHTML -->
<img src=&quot;path/to/file.jpg&quot; /&gt;

<!-- HTML5 -->
<img src=&quot;path/to/file.jpg&quot;&gt;

```

        </script>
</section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
            
#Add Flexslider to Your project: Step 3

**Initialize** the plugin by adding this bit of code into your `$(document).ready()` function:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    // Add all jQuery code here.
    $('.flexslider').flexslider();
});
```  
Yep, that's it. Let's break that down.

```javascript
   $('.flexslider').flexslider();
/* |      |          |        └ Parentheses indicate a function call
   |      |          └ The Flexslider method 
   |      └ The selector will add any items with the class 'flexslider' to the jQuery wrapped set 
   └ The jQuery function            
*/
```

Save and refresh the browser.
        </script>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
#It works! Sort of...

Depending how you want your slider to look, it may be too big or too small for your page.  By default, it will be as wide as its containing element.

Also, it looks like the left & right arrow is missing.  If yours looks something like the below screen shot, it's okay.  We can customize it.

![flexslider default](framework/img/workshop/flexslider-default.png)
        </script>
</section>
        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
# I Can Haz Responsive?

Flexslider comes out of the box with the ability to be responsive. That's why, by default, it's stretching to 100% width of it's container. Try resizing your browser and watch your images scale as needed.

We can fix this with a little HTML & CSS and still maintain its responsive nature. Let's put a new containing element around the Flexslider HTML like this:

```
<div class=&quot;flexslider-wrap&quot;&gt;<!-- new container--&gt;

    <div class=&quot;flexslider&quot;&gt;
        <ul class=&quot;slides&quot;&gt;
            <li&gt;<img src=&quot;images/rotator/image1.jpg&quot;&gt;</li&gt;
            <li&gt;<img src=&quot;images/rotator/image2.jpg&quot;&gt;</li&gt;
            <li&gt;<img src=&quot;images/rotator/image3.jpg&quot;&gt;</li&gt;
        </ul&gt;
    </div&gt;

</div&gt;<!-- closing new container --&gt;
```
Then add the css to **styles.css** to change the size of the whole container.

    .flexslider-wrap {
        width: 50%; /* makes the slider 50% of its container */
        margin: 0 auto; /* center aligns the slider */
    }

Check your page, much better right?

**Pro Tip:**
Make your images only as wide as they NEED to be.  That is, the largest size that you will need in your design.  They will automatically scale down as needed, but if you make them larger then they need to be the file size will be larger and your page will download slower.
        </script>
</section>

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
#One more fix

Now let's fix those missing arrows.  Usually, when you see a broken image or something is not working properly, the first thing to check for is "Are all my files where they need to be?"

In **flexslider.css**, the source location for the fonts look like this:

    @font-face {
        font-family: 'flexslider-icon';
        src:url('fonts/flexslider-icon.eot');
        src:url('fonts/flexslider-icon.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
            url('fonts/flexslider-icon.woff') format('woff'),
            url('fonts/flexslider-icon.ttf') format('truetype'),
            url('fonts/flexslider-icon.svg#flexslider-icon') format('svg');
        font-weight: normal;
        font-style: normal;
    }

In the previous step, we put our **fonts** folder *outside* of the **css** folder.  This CSS source needs to be updated to point to where the font files are.

Update this to:

    @font-face {
        font-family: 'flexslider-icon';
        src:url('../fonts/flexslider-icon.eot');
        src:url('../fonts/flexslider-icon.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
            url('../fonts/flexslider-icon.woff') format('woff'),
            url('../fonts/flexslider-icon.ttf') format('truetype'),
            url('../fonts/flexslider-icon.svg#flexslider-icon') format('svg');
        font-weight: normal;
        font-style: normal;
    }

Your starting point is **flexslider.css**.  The `../` means "Go up and out of a folder", then go into the **fonts** folder.  Go ahead and make that change.

Another option is to just move the font folder inside the css folder.  The source in the CSS file just needs to match the directory location.

# Customizations

Though this is a pre-written plugin, many plugin authors will provide ways to add various options for further customizations of the plugin. 

A couple of Flexslider's available options are:

* Animation Type: **fade** or **slide**
* Animation Speed: Set the speed of animations, in milliseconds.

There are many more options, you can [see a complete list on this page](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/#gist9481310).

Let's look at how to set these two options.

# Using A Configuration Object with Flexslider

Go to this line of code in your document: 
```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider();
```  
And change it to the below example. Does that syntax look familiar? [Remember objects](#slide28)?
```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider({ animation : "slide" });
```  
Then reload your page.  Notice how your flexslider will now animate new slides in from the right to the left instead of disolving between the two images.  Now change it to say this:
```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider({ animationSpeed : 2000 });
```  
Reload that.  Do you notice a difference?

If you want to use multiple options, you can just separate them with a comma like this:
```javascript
$('.flexslider').flexslider({ 
    animation : "slide",
    animationSpeed : 2000 
});
```

#Searching for what you need

Luckily we have wonderful community of developers that create code snippets and share them with the rest of the world. The main goal is to be able to write our own code from scratch, but why not use tried–and–true methods that have already been created by the experts?

One of the many small effects one can add to a site to give it that little extra sumthin' sumthin' is a smooth scroll. There are many plugins that can do some fancy tricks but to add a simple smooth scroll to our one page site, we can use this little snippet created by [Chris Coyier of css-tricks.com](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/).

Let's look at this snippet, then add it to our project.

```javascript
$('a[href*=#]:not([href=#])').click(function() {
    if (location.pathname.replace(/^\//,'') == this.pathname.replace(/^\//,'') && location.hostname == this.hostname) {
        var target = $(this.hash);
        target = target.length ? target : $('[name=' + this.hash.slice(1) +']');

        if (target.length) {
            $('html,body').animate({
              scrollTop: target.offset().top
            }, 1000);
            return false;
        }
    }
